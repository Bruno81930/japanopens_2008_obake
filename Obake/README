===========
REQUIREMENT
===========
The soccerwindow2-2.0.0 requires the following libraries:
 - boost-1.32 or later
 - librcsc-1.3.x

=====
BUILD
=====
From the agent2d directory execute:

./configure
make

If you did not install the librcsc into the system directory, you will
need to set the configure's `--with-librcsc=DIR' option as follows:

./configure --with-librcsc=/path/to/librcsc/prefix

In this case, you will also need to set the environment variable
LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

===========
CONFIGURING
===========
Before you build the agent2d, you must run the `configure' script
located in the root of the distribution directory. See `configure
--help' for more details.

==============
START THE TEAM
==============
To start the agent2d team type

`./start.sh'

from the directory containing the executable.
